1.  Introduction

   The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [RFC2743] is a framework that provides security services to
   applications using a variety of authentication mechanisms.  There are
   widely implemented C bindings [RFC2744] of the abstract interface.

   Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] is a
   framework to provide authentication and security layers for
   connection-based protocols, also using a variety of mechanisms.

   The GS2 mechanism bridge framework [RFC5801] describes how every GSS-
   API mechanisms can be used as a SASL mechanism.  Indirectly, the
   document also describes how a SASL mechanism (if designed carefully)
   can be a GSS-API mechanism.  The purpose of this document is to
   expand the "if designed carefully" remark.

   We also mention issues for designers of native GSS-API mechanisms, so
   that they work as smoothly as possible with SASL applications.

   The hope is that future SASL mechanisms will (when possible) be
   designed in a way so that they are valid GSS-API mechanisms that are
   used in SASL through GS2.  Understanding the issues and following the
   recommendations in this document will hopefully make this an easy and
   wortwhile task.

   The document uses terms from [RFC2743], [RFC2744] and [RFC4422].

2.  Issues for SASL mechanisms

   This section discusses issues concerning designers of SASL mechanism,
   so that their SASL mechanisms may be used as GSS-API mechanisms as
   well.

2.1.  Client-First

   GSS-API and GS2 mechanisms always have client-initiated
   authentication message exchanges, in SASL terms, thus any SASL
   mechanism that wants to be the equivalent of a GSS-API mechanism that
   is wire compatible when used under GS2, also needs to be client-
   initiated.  For some mechanisms this may mean having a constant
   initial authentication message.

2.2.  Assigning an OID

   Every GSS-API mechanism is identified by an OID.  For example, the
   OID for the SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism ([RFC5802]) is 1.3.6.1.5.5.14.

   Thus, SASL mechanisms should have an OID allocated for them so they
   can used as GSS-API mechanisms.

   For SASL mechanism families, it is difficult to say anything in
   general.  Often the mechanism family concept is used to provide for
   negotiation of cryptographic algorithms (particularly for hash
   agility).  It is natural for each member of the mechanism family to
   have its own OID arc from which OIDs are assigned.

2.3.  The GS2 header

   All initial GSS-API security context tokens normally start with a DER
   encoded header bearing the OID of the selected mechanism (see section
   3.1 of [RFC5802]).  The GSS-API header also includes a DER-encoded
   length of the rest of the security context token.  Because this
   header is not neither constant, nor easy to encode nor decode, GS2
   removes this header, and replaces it with a header given by a "gs2-
   header" ABNF production, see section 4 of [RFC5801].  The syntax of
   the "gs2-header" is briefly as follows (NOTE: this is an INFORMATIVE
   copy):

    gs2-nonstd-flag = "F"
                      ;; "F" means the mechanism is not a
                      ;; standard GSS-API mechanism in that the
                      ;; RFC 2743, Section 3.1 header was missing
    gs2-cb-flag     = ("p=" cb-name) / "n" / "y"
                      ;; GS2 channel binding (CB) flag
                      ;; "p" -> client supports and used CB
                      ;; "n" -> client does not support CB
                      ;; "y" -> client supports CB, thinks the
                      ;;           server does not
    gs2-authzid    = "a=" saslname
                      ;; GS2 has to transport an authzid since
                      ;; the GSS-API has no equivalent
    gs2-header = [gs2-nonstd-flag ","] gs2-cb-flag "," [gs2-authzid] ","

   Therefore, to be GS2 compatible, the first client authentication
   message for a SASL mechanism should begin with the "gs2-header".

2.4.  Zero Length Messages

   Some SASL mechanisms use zero-length messages to indicate completion
   of some step when there's no additional data to send to the peer.
   The GSS-API specification [RFC2743] contains the following sentence:

      Zero-length tokens are never returned by GSS routines
      for transfer to a peer.

   Thus any SASL mechanism that wishes to be a GSS-API mechanism cannot
   use zero-length messages.  Instead, for example, the mechanism can
   send a constant, one-octet message.

2.5.  Per-Message Tokens

   GSS-API mechanisms typically provide applications the ability to
   protect (integrity and confidentiality) arbitrary data after the
   security context has been negotiated.  If your SASL mechanism is able
   to derive shared symmetric keys, it is possible to specify how per-
   message GSS-API tokens would work.

   A simple way to achieve this is to re-use the per-message tokens of
   the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121], using a specific
   Kerberos V enctype [RFC3961] (currently the strongest enctype is
   based on AES [RFC3962].  The mechanism specification must also
   specify how to obtain two "protocol" keys, one for each direction.
   For example, see section 8.2 of [RFC5802].

2.6.  GSS_Pseudo_random

   The GSS_Pseudo_random facility [RFC4401] provides GSS-API
   applications an interface to a mechanism-specific PRF.  If your SASL
   mechanism is able to derive any shared symmetric keys, it is possible
   to have the corresponding GSS-API mechanism support
   GSS_Pseudo_random.  A simple way to achieve this is to re-use the
   Kerberos V PRF [RFC4402].  For example, see section 8.3 of [RFC5802].

2.7.  GSS-API Mechanism Attributes

   Indicating what [RFC5587] attributes the resulting GSS-API mechanism
   will have is useful for GSS-API application writers.  Standards-track
   GSS mechanisms MUST have the GSS_C_MA_ITOK_FRAMED attribute.  The set
   of attributes usually include GSS_C_MA_MECH_CONCRETE,
   GSS_C_MA_ITOK_FRAMED, GSS_C_MA_AUTH_INIT, GSS_C_MA_AUTH_TARG (if
   mutual authentication is supported), and GSS_C_MA_CBINDINGS.

3.  Issues for GSS-API mechanisms

3.1.  Mutual Authentication and Channel Binding

   It is highly desirable that GSS-API and SASL mechanisms support
   mutual authentication and channel binding [RFC5056].

   SASL mechanisms that support channel binding must prefix the gs2-
   header [RFC5801] to the application-provided channel bindings data.

3.2.  Allocate a SASL mechanism name

   The GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech and GSS_Inquire_mech_for_SASLname
   calls are used to map between SASL mechanism name and GSS-API
   mechanism OID.

   For this reason, new GSS-API mechanisms should specify a SASL
   mechanism name conforming to the syntactical rules in [RFC4422].  If
   a SASL name is not specified, then the mechanism's SASL name will be
   derived from its GSS-API mechanism OID by hashing it.
